The aim of this OpenEmbedded layer is to provide replacements
for the SysV skeleton scripts that are provided by the (amongst 
others) sysvinit, sysv-inittab and initscripts packages.

Adding this layer will explicitly disable systemd's SysV compat
functionality.

This layer is *NOT* intended for providing systemd .service files
for regular packages that are usually started from /etc/rc{2,3,4,5}.d.
Those packages should provide the necessary systemd files themselves.
